Create Spotify developer app:
    To create an app, go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard, 
    click on the Create an app button and enter the following information:
        Redirect URIs: http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback
        API/SDKs: Web API

    You do not need to write anything for the rest of the variables, 
    expect for App Name and App description, where you are free to write
    whatever you want.


Setup environment variables:
    Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard -> app you just created ->
    Settings and copy the client ID and client secret, which is hidden by 
    default. Now, paste those in the .env file which is in the same directory
    as this one, like this:
        SPOTIFREE_CLIENT_ID=exampleID
        SPOTIFREE_CLIENT_SECRET=exampleSecret
